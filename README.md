Introduction:
Netflix has disrupted the television and cinema industry over the last decade. It has given its audience a far more comfortable, flexible and customizable experience in the media content that they want to consume.
In this project, I aim to do a deep dive into how the tv and cinema industry has reacted to the evolution of a streaming service like Netflix over the years. I explore the genres of content produced by Netflix and any changes that occur based on the time of the year.
